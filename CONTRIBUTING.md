# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the OpenFreeMap Telegram Mini App! This guide explains how to get a local environment running, how we review changes, and where to start if you are new to the project.

## Local Development Options

We support two main workflows. Pick the one that matches the tools you already have.

### Option A – One-command Docker stack
1. Install Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) and Docker Compose.
2. Copy the backend environment template: `cp backend/.env.example backend/.env` and set `BOT_TOKEN` plus any overrides you need.
3. Run everything with one command:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This boots Postgres, the API, the Vite frontend, and an Nginx proxy. Hot reloads are wired in, so contributors do not need separate `npm run dev` windows.
4. To share the stack with Telegram, expose the Nginx port using your tunnel of choice:
   ```bash
   ngrok http http://localhost:8000
   ```
   Register the public URL with BotFather and you are ready to test the Mini App end-to-end.

### Option B – Hosted Supabase + Node
1. Create a Supabase project and obtain your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
2. Run the schema found at `backend/database/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Configure backend environment variables (`backend/.env`):
   ```env
   BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-miniapp-host
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_public_key
   ```
4. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Start the frontend in the project root:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev:https
   ```
6. (Optional) If you need an HTTP dev server use `npm run dev`. For production builds run `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`.

### Shared Tips
- The frontend loads configuration from environment variables exposed via Vite. Consult `README.md` for additional flags.
- Tailwind classes are co-located with components. Prefer composing utility classes rather than adding new global CSS.
- When developing UI flows without Telegram, open `https://localhost:5173` directly in your browser and use the mocked data utilities.

## Development Workflow
- Fork the repository or create a feature branch.
- Unsure about scope? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Telegram-Mini-Apps/tma-ofm-react-template/issues) so we can help refine the work before you code.
- Keep commits small and descriptive; we follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g. `feat: add poi clustering`).
- Run `npm run lint` from the project root before opening a pull request. Please fix any reported issues (`npm run lint:fix`).
- If you touch backend code, run the backend locally and exercise the `/health` endpoint to ensure there are no runtime errors.
- Update documentation (README, docs, or this file) when behaviour or setup changes.
- Include screenshots or recordings for UI changes in your pull request description.
